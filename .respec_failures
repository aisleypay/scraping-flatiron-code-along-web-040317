Scraper #get_page uses Nokogiri to get the HTML from a web page
Scraper #get_courses uses a CSS selector to return an array of Nokogiri XML elements representing the courses described on the web page we are scraping
Scraper #make_courses iterates over the courses array returned by #get_courses and creates a new Course instance out of each array element.
